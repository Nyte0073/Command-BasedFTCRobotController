Instructions for downloading this repository from the github
************************************************************

First off, make sure that your JAVA_HOME variable in your ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section of your advanced settings 
is set to JDK 11 because this android studio project uses Java 11 to compile code.

Secondly, make sure that your GRADLE_HOME variable in your ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section of your advanced settings
is set to gradle version 7.4 because that is the prime version for this situation since this gradle project uses 
gradle version 7.3.0 for compiling and building code, so having gradle 7.4 will ensure without any errors your gradle
is updated enough to provide the correct dependencies for your program to run Java 11 to compile code (hopefully, if
you don't edit anything and then get into an Android Studio error loop and then just continue to make MORE ERRORS BY GUESSING
WHAT TO DO AND CHANGING RANDOM STUFF UNTIL IT WORKS (COUGH COUGH, DECLAN, COUGH, COUGH)).
